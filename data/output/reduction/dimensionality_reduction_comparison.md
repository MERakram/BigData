# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques Comparison Report

*Generated on: 2025-03-13 03:48*

## 1. Introduction

This report presents a comprehensive comparison between two dimensionality reduction techniques: t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) and MDS (Multidimensional Scaling). Both techniques are used to visualize high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space, but they differ in their approaches, performance characteristics, and results.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Features Used

The comparison was performed using the following features:

- **happiness_score**
- **gdp_per_capita_eur**
- **exchange_rate_eur**

### 2.2 t-SNE Parameters

- **Perplexity**: 30
- **Random State**: 42 (for reproducibility)

*Note: Perplexity in t-SNE can be interpreted as a guess about the number of close neighbors each point has. The performance is fairly robust to changes in perplexity, with typical values between 5 and 50.*

### 2.3 MDS Parameters

- **Type**: Metric
- **Random State**: 42 (for reproducibility)

*Note: Metric MDS preserves the actual distances between points, while non-metric MDS preserves only the ordering of the distances.*

## 3. Comparison Results

### 3.1 Performance Metrics

| Metric | t-SNE | MDS |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Execution Time (s) | 0.40 | 0.03 |
| Number of Samples | 152 | 152 |
| Silhouette Score | 0.480 | 0.403 |
| Stress Value | N/A | 63.0028 |

### 3.2 Cluster Preservation

Based on the silhouette scores, **t-SNE** preserved the cluster structure better by a margin of 0.077. The highest silhouette score indicates fair cluster preservation, with moderately separated clusters in the reduced space.

#### Cluster Distribution Comparison

| Cluster | t-SNE Count | t-SNE % | MDS Count | MDS % |
|---------|------------|---------|-----------|-------|
| 0 | 52 | 34.2% | 52 | 34.2% |
| 1 | 41 | 27.0% | 41 | 27.0% |
| 2 | 55 | 36.2% | 55 | 36.2% |

## 4. Interpretation of Results

### 4.1 t-SNE Performance

t-SNE is particularly effective at preserving local structure in the data, focusing on keeping similar points close together in the reduced space. This makes it excellent for visualizing clusters and revealing local patterns.

As expected, t-SNE took longer to execute than MDS, which is typical due to its more complex optimization process, especially for larger datasets.

### 4.2 MDS Performance

The metric MDS implementation used in this analysis focuses on preserving the actual distances between points in the high-dimensional space. This approach differs from t-SNE's focus on preserving local structure.

The MDS stress value of 63.0028 indicates poor fit quality. This suggests some distortion in the 2D representation compared to the high-dimensional distances.

### 4.3 Method Comparison

Both t-SNE and MDS have their strengths and limitations when visualizing high-dimensional data:

**t-SNE Advantages:**
- Excels at preserving local structure and revealing clusters
- Often produces more visually appealing visualizations for exploration
- Better at handling non-linear relationships in the data

**t-SNE Limitations:**
- Can't reliably preserve global structure (distances between well-separated clusters)
- Results can vary with different random initializations
- Parameter sensitive (especially to perplexity)
- Typically slower for large datasets

**MDS Advantages:**
- Better at preserving global structure and actual distances
- Provides a stress measure to evaluate the quality of the embedding
- Results are more stable across runs
- Often faster than t-SNE, especially for larger datasets

**MDS Limitations:**
- May not reveal local structure as effectively as t-SNE
- Metric MDS assumes distances in the high-dimensional space are meaningful
- Can perform poorly when the data has a complex non-linear structure

## 5. Recommendation

Based on the comparison results, **t-SNE is recommended** as it shows better cluster preservation for this dataset. The higher silhouette score indicates that t-SNE more effectively captures the cluster structure in the reduced 2D space.

While t-SNE takes longer to execute, the improved cluster preservation likely justifies the additional computational cost.

## 6. Conclusion

This comparative analysis of t-SNE and MDS dimensionality reduction techniques provides insights into their respective strengths, limitations, and performance characteristics when applied to country data.

The choice between these techniques depends on the specific goals of the analysis:

- **For cluster visualization and local structure exploration**: t-SNE typically excels at revealing clusters and local patterns.
- **For preserving global structure and actual distances**: MDS is often more reliable.
- **For computational efficiency**: The faster method depends on the specific dataset and implementation.

For comprehensive analysis, using both techniques in conjunction can provide complementary perspectives on the high-dimensional data structure.
