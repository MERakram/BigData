# Metric MDS Dimensionality Reduction Analysis Report

*Generated on: 2025-03-13 03:08*

## 1. Introduction

This report presents the results of applying Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) to country data. MDS is a technique that preserves pairwise distances between data points when reducing dimensionality, making it useful for understanding global structure and visualizing relationships between countries based on economic and well-being indicators.

## 2. Methodology

The Metric MDS algorithm was applied to 152 countries using the following features:

- **happiness_score**
- **exchange_rate_eur**

**Parameters:**

- **Type**: Metric MDS
- **Random state**: 42 (for reproducibility)

## 3. Execution Statistics

- **Runtime**: 0.07 seconds
- **Number of countries analyzed**: 152
- **Number of features**: 2
- **Stress**: 63.0028
  - Lower stress values indicate better preservation of distances
- **Cluster separation (silhouette score)**: 0.403
  - A higher silhouette score (closer to 1.0) indicates better-defined clusters

## 4. Results Interpretation

### 4.1 Overall Patterns

The MDS visualization reveals several key patterns in the country data:

1. **Distance Preservation**: MDS preserves distances between data points, meaning countries that are dissimilar in the original feature space (happiness, GDP, and exchange rate) appear farther apart in the 2D visualization.

2. **Global Structure**: Unlike t-SNE, MDS focuses on preserving the global structure of the data, making it valuable for understanding overall patterns and relationships between all countries.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction Quality**: The relatively high stress value indicates that significant distortion was introduced when reducing the data to 2D, suggesting caution when interpreting fine details.

### 4.2 Cluster Analysis in MDS Space

The following statistics describe each cluster in the reduced MDS space:

**Cluster 0** (52 countries):

- **Representative countries**: China, Indonesia, Pakistan
- **Average happiness score**: 5.74
- **Average GDP per capita (EUR)**: nan
- **Average exchange rate to EUR**: 0.0905
- **Position in MDS space**: (0.01, -0.29)

**Cluster 1** (41 countries):

- **Representative countries**: United States, Germany, France
- **Average happiness score**: 6.59
- **Average GDP per capita (EUR)**: nan
- **Average exchange rate to EUR**: 0.9056
- **Position in MDS space**: (0.48, -1.12)

**Cluster 2** (55 countries):

- **Representative countries**: India, Bangladesh, Ethiopia
- **Average happiness score**: 4.26
- **Average GDP per capita (EUR)**: nan
- **Average exchange rate to EUR**: 0.0219
- **Position in MDS space**: (-0.38, 1.13)

### 4.3 Limitations

When interpreting MDS visualizations, it's important to consider the following limitations:

1. **Distance Interpretation**: MDS aims to preserve distances, but perfect preservation in lower dimensions isn't always possible, especially when reducing from many features to just 2D.

2. **Stress Value Importance**: Higher stress values indicate greater distortion in the visualization. This analysis has a stress value of 63.00284632620558.

3. **Linear vs. Non-linear**: Metric MDS assumes linear relationships between features, which may not always hold for complex socioeconomic data.

## 5. Conclusion

The MDS dimensionality reduction visualizes the global relationships between countries based on their happiness scores, GDP per capita, and currency exchange rates. The visualization effectively preserves the cluster structure identified in the K-means analysis, providing an intuitive way to understand the relationships between different countries.

MDS is particularly valuable for this dataset because it focuses on preserving the distances between all countries, giving a reliable global view of how countries relate to each other in terms of economic and well-being metrics. This global perspective complements the more locally-focused t-SNE approach, and together they provide a comprehensive understanding of the data structure.
