# t-SNE Dimensionality Reduction Analysis Report

*Generated on: 2025-03-13 03:07*

## 1. Introduction

This report presents the results of applying t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) dimensionality reduction to country data. t-SNE is particularly effective at visualizing high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two-dimensional map, while preserving local structure in the original data.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Features Used

The analysis was performed using the following features:

- **happiness_score**
- **exchange_rate_eur**

### 2.2 t-SNE Parameters

- **Perplexity**: 30
- **Iterations**: Default
- **Learning Rate**: Default

*Note: Perplexity can be interpreted as a guess about the number of close neighbors each point has. The performance of t-SNE is fairly robust to changes in perplexity, with typical values between 5 and 50.*

## 3. Analysis Results

### 3.1 Summary Statistics

- **Number of countries analyzed**: 152
- **Number of features**: 2
- **Execution time**: 0.37 seconds

### 3.2 Cluster Preservation

- **Silhouette score**: 0.480

The silhouette score indicates **fair** cluster preservation. t-SNE has preserved some cluster structure. The clusters have moderate separation in the reduced space.

#### Cluster Distribution in t-SNE Space

| Cluster | Count | Percentage |
|---------|-------|------------|
| 0 | 52 | 34.2% |
| 1 | 41 | 27.0% |
| 2 | 55 | 36.2% |

### 3.3 t-SNE Visualization Assessment

The t-SNE visualization has mapped the high-dimensional country data to a 2D space. This mapping preserves local structure, meaning that countries which are similar in terms of happiness, GDP, and currency strength are placed close together in the 2D map.

When examining the t-SNE visualization, consider the following:

1. **Clusters**: Countries forming distinct clusters may represent groups with similar economic and happiness characteristics.
2. **Outliers**: Countries appearing isolated in the visualization may have unique combinations of features.
3. **Gradients**: Gradual transitions between regions can indicate continuous relationships between economic factors and happiness.

*Note: t-SNE focuses on preserving local structure, so distances between well-separated clusters in the visualization are not necessarily meaningful. The global arrangement of clusters should not be over-interpreted.*

## 4. Interpretation of Results

### 4.2 Currency Strength Patterns

Currency exchange rates add an additional dimension to our understanding of economic wellbeing. In the t-SNE visualization, countries with similar currency strength relative to the Euro may be positioned near each other if this factor plays a significant role in the overall country profile.

The visualization may reveal whether currency strength correlates with other factors or forms its own distinct patterns in the data structure.

### 4.3 Comparison with K-means Clustering

The t-SNE visualization is colored according to the K-means clusters previously identified. This allows us to see how well the dimensionality reduction has preserved the cluster structure.

The moderate/low silhouette score suggests that some cluster structure may be lost in the dimensionality reduction process. This could indicate that the clusters exist in dimensions that t-SNE didn't prioritize in its non-linear mapping, or that the clusters themselves are not strongly separated in the original space.

## 5. Limitations

When interpreting the t-SNE results, it's important to be aware of the following limitations:

1. **Loss of Information**: The dimensionality reduction from multiple features to just two dimensions inevitably loses some information. Some patterns visible in the original high-dimensional space may not be visible in the t-SNE visualization.

2. **Non-linear Mapping**: t-SNE performs a non-linear transformation that focuses on preserving local structure. This means that global patterns and distances between well-separated points are not accurately represented.

3. **Random Initialization**: t-SNE involves random initialization, so running the algorithm multiple times can produce different visualizations. The general patterns should remain similar, but the specific layout may vary.

4. **Parameter Sensitivity**: The perplexity parameter affects how t-SNE balances attention between local and global aspects of the data. Different perplexity values might highlight different patterns.

## 6. Conclusion

The t-SNE analysis provides a valuable visualization of the relationships between happiness and currency strength across different countries. By reducing the dimensionality while preserving local structure, t-SNE helps reveal patterns that might be difficult to detect in the original high-dimensional space.

The visualization complements the previous correlation and clustering analyses by providing a spatial representation of country similarities and differences. Countries that are positioned close together in the visualization generally have similar characteristics in terms of the selected features.

For further analysis, it would be valuable to compare these t-SNE results with those from other dimensionality reduction techniques, such as MDS (Multidimensional Scaling), to see if different methods highlight different aspects of the data structure.
